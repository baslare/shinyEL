# Shiny App for generating Euroleague Shot Charts - Hex and Heat Maps


### UPDATE: March 6th, 2022 - all the seasons 2014 through 2022 are now available!

Hi! this is the repo with the scripts for the Shiny app I built for creating shot charts and heat maps similar to those below. I have also supplied demo data that you can use for, well, doing practically the same thing!

Go to https://baslare.net/elChart.html to give it a try! I personally really like how it looks and looking to update the app in the future!
